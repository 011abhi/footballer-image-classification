🎯 Classifying Footballer Images with Machine Learning! ⚽

I’m excited to share a project I recently worked on that combines machine learning and image processing to classify images of famous footballers using Support Vector Machines (SVM). 🧠✨

🔍 Project Highlights:

Objective: Develop an intelligent system to recognize and classify images of renowned football players.
Machine Learning Algorithm: Leveraged the power of SVM for its robustness and efficiency in handling complex datasets.
Image Processing Techniques:
Used Haar Cascade Classifiers and OpenCV to detect faces and key features (eyes, etc.).
Incorporated Wavelet Transform (Haar) for feature extraction to enhance classification accuracy.
Interactive Interface: Built a sleek and user-friendly Streamlit interface for seamless image upload and classification, providing real-time feedback.
📈 How It Works:

Upload an image: The system processes the input using Haar cascades to detect faces with two eyes.
Feature Extraction: Apply wavelet transforms to emphasize distinguishing features.
Classification: The pre-trained SVM model predicts the player with probabilities and provides insightful descriptions.
🔧 Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, PyWavelets, NumPy, Streamlit
Models and Preprocessing: Haar Cascade for face and eye detection, SVM for classification
